Scan Those Gates adds three abilities.

Remote Gate Scan: scans all gates in systems with at least one non-hidden (not pirate/pather base) market, and adds the scanned gates to the intel screen. Settings.json options are available to change the ability to also activate gates in marketless systems or just add them to the intel screen.

Remote Hypershunt Survey: scans all Coronal Hypershunts in the sector, adds their location to the intel screen under the "Megastructures" tab, and adds markers to the intel map.

Remote Cryosleeper Survey: scans all Cryosleepers in the sector, adds their location to the intel screen under the "Megastructures" tab, and adds markers to the intel map.

If the mod is added after a game has been started, the abilities will be automatically added. Scan Those Gates can be safely removed from an active game by running the console command "RemoveScanThoseGates", saving the game, and then removing the mod.
